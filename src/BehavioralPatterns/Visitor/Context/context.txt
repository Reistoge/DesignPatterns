A museum needs to manage different types of artworks
(Paint, Sculpture, Photograph) and perform various
operations on them like generating reports,
calculating insurance values, and exporting data.

public class Artwork {
    private String name;
    private double value;

    public void generatePdfReport() {
        if (this instanceof Paint) {
            System.out.println("Generating PDF for painting");
        } else if (this instanceof Sculpture) {
            System.out.println("Generating PDF for sculpture");
        } else if (this instanceof Photograph) {
            System.out.println("Generating PDF for photograph");
        }
    }

    public void calculateInsurance() {
        if (this instanceof Paint) {
            System.out.println("Calculating insurance for painting");
        } else if (this instanceof Sculpture) {
            System.out.println("Calculating insurance for sculpture");
        } else if (this instanceof Photograph) {
            System.out.println("Calculating insurance for photograph");
        }
    }

    public void exportToCsv() {
        if (this instanceof Paint) {
            System.out.println("Exporting painting to CSV");
        } else if (this instanceof Sculpture) {
            System.out.println("Exporting sculpture to CSV");
        } else if (this instanceof Photograph) {
            System.out.println("Exporting photograph to CSV");
        }
    }
}
