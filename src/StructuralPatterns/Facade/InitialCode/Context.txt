Context:
You`re building a media player system, to play a song you have to manually
decoding, buffering this creates tight coupling between the high-level
application logic and the low level subsystems.

Solution.
Instead of using N the concrete subsystems or interfaces in the same client code,
you create a "Facade" class that provides a simplified interface to the subsystems.
by this, you reduce the complexity in the client code so the client just calls the facade methods
and the facade will take care of calling the subsystems.
