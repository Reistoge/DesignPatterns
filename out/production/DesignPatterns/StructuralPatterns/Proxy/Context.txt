You're developing a custom game editor for your
2D game project. In the editor, the artist or level
designer can browse through assets (images, sprites, animations)
before placing them on the scene.

These assets are large and stored remotely (in cloud storage or on disk),
 and loading them all at once is too expensive in memory and time.

Problem:
You need to show a preview of the asset (maybe a thumbnail or a name),
but only load the actual image when the user wants to use it.
